	There was a guy named Gavin. Gavin wan't just an ordinary person. He 
had a secret super power. Whatever he said, or whatever he didn't said, would
be correct and important to the eyes of others. For instance, when Gavin was
still a student,once, his teacher asked him to give definition of a word. "I
don't know", said Gavin. His teacher thought, "Impossible! He must be 
suggesting something". Then the teacher spent a day reading and found out that
word has a different meaning centuries ago. Then his teacher thought, "What a 
genius! He even knew my question wasn't clarified enough."

	Because of his power, Gavin aced his classes, and anyone he spoke to
saw him as some kind of supergenius. His power essentially warped reality for 
any who heard him speak; to those unfortunate individuals, fiction became fact
and fatc became fiction. Though unintentional, his ability soon began to ruin 
the minds of all those around him
